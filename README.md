Ad Campaign Performance Analyzer üìä
Project Overview
The Ad Campaign Performance Analyzer is a data-driven project designed to analyze and visualize the performance of digital ad campaigns across multiple channels.
It showcases how to use SQL, Python automation, and Looker Studio dashboards to extract meaningful insights, automate data workflows, and improve marketing efficiency.
